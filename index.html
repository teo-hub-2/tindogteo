          <h3>Software Engineering & Web Developement & Computer Science</h3>
          <p class="computer-p">
            I started coding at the age of 11. I was interested in coding
            because my uncle was a progrmmer and i was inspired by the creations
            what he did and the amount of money what the did per mouth (I had 6
            years old when i was dreaming to became a programmer).Now I'm 13
            years old and I'm a web application developer (Software Engineer)
            and now i am learning Computer Science online (Algorithms and Data
            Structures).

          <h3>Chess</h3>
          <p class="chess-p">
            Chess is one of my good skills that prefer to present. I started to
            love chess not long time ago , and I found out that chess in an
            attention game a focus came like programming ('cause in programming
            you shoud focus on the problem and to be careful at all the code
            witch you written).

          <p class="science-p">
            I started to understand Phisics when i had 8 years old 'cause my
            grandpa is a physicist. I started learning phisics in 1st grade with
            my granpa but i did not understand a word.
